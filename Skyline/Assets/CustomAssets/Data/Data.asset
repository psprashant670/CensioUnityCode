  IntroMessages:
  - Hello! Welcome to the city of Manhattan. Join me on this building modernization
    project.
  - You need to build 4 skyscrapers in a stipulated time. Work through various challenges
    that come along the way!
  - You get 4 attempts to complete each level. You score coins based on your accuracy
    of the building them and not the number of blocks!
  - Reward coins are awarded depending on the number of attempts you take to stack
    the skyscraper blocks perfectly.
  - "Completion on the first attempt will get you most coins. If you click on the
    \u201CMove On\u201D button, you lose the remaining attempts for that level. However,
    you can still play the other levels."
